                One of us found it difficult to rent a room abroad while subletting their
                room at home. So we built Housing Easy as a student-to-student messaging
                forum. A year later we expanded to other European countries, including
                Spain, France, Germany, and Denmark. Afterwards, we introduced an online
                booking system and expanded globally by collaborating with universities in
                Brazil, Mexico and U.S.A.
